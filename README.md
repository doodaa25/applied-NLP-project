# Applied NLP Project — Comparing *War and Peace* & *Anna Karenina*

This project explores linguistic patterns in two novels by Leo Tolstoy using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## 📚 Project Overview
We analyze three dimensions of language use:

1. **Frequent Words** – thematic word frequency and distinctiveness using Dunning’s G² test  
2. **Gendered Language** – frequency and bias in male- vs female-coded terms and their collocates  
3. **Adverbs** – stylistic comparison through adverb frequency and distinctiveness

Each analysis is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.
