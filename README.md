# 🧠 Applied NLP Project — Comparing *War and Peace* & *Anna Karenina*

This project explores linguistic patterns in two novels by **Leo Tolstoy** using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

---

## 📚 Project Overview
We analyze three major linguistic dimensions:

1. **Frequent Words** – thematic word frequency and distinctiveness using Dunning’s G² test.  
2. **Gendered Language** – frequency and bias in male- vs female-coded pronouns and their nearby verbs.  
3. **Adverbs** – stylistic comparison through adverb frequency and distinctiveness.  

Each analysis is implemented as a Jupyter Notebook in the `notebooks/` folder.
